# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model – Your First MLOps Project (FastAPI + Docker + K8s)
### 🚀 Project Goal

This project helps you learn how to **build and deploy a Machine Learning model** using a simple, real-world use case:  
> **Predicting whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics.**

We’ll go from:

- ✅ **Model Training**
- ✅ **Building the Model Locally**
- ✅ **API Deployment with FastAPI**
- ✅ **Dockerization**
- ✅ **Kubernetes Deployment**

  ### 📊 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to **predict whether a person is diabetic** based on the following health metrics:

- 🍼 **Pregnancies**
- 🍬 **Glucose**
- 💓 **Blood Pressure**
- ⚖️ **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- 🎂 **Age**

We use a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to make predictions.

This dataset is widely used for binary classification problems in healthcare and is ideal for beginners learning ML pipelines and deployment.
